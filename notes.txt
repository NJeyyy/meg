- finish other things (settings, experiments place)
- experiment place, to use real-time calculator (only placeholder for now)

  *I think, using mutationobserver is best(?)
- sound effects?
- clean up the settings's css, i just wanted it done so.. perhaps it can look better?.. later
  *the select box style, perhaps it can be improved...?
- feature for user to go fullscreen by scrolling on the top (that usually used for refreshing, but just replace it with that)
- replace setting's parameter name from "isLocal" to something else thus modifying most of the other file code.

- add more support for offline use
