- experiment place, to use real-time calculator (only placeholder for now)

on-going:
~ exit button, terminate the server too [TESTING NEEDED, on mobile]
  *finished, but need to add new page so when the user click the button it will

  [also testing the `exit` code if it works to stopped termux's terminal..?]
