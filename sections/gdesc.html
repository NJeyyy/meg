  Hello, and thank you for giving us a chance to introduce this game!
</p><p>
  This game is inspired from TTRS. Now, actually I never play or 
  try this game at all,I just saw someone playing it. 
  A video of a kid speedrunning this game, it feels like flexing and 
  I really want to try! 
  Well, that is, until I found out this game is not free. 
  And I can't really found a similar game! or the working one at that. 
  And that's how this game born XD<br>

  MEG stands for Math Exuberance Game. Well, initially it is called MEG because it sounded similar to math meth and then meg. 
  I just love using a name that usually used for a person on something lolol. 
  But I feel like, it would be cool if the "E" had a meaning as well, since the "M" and "G" seems already so obvious.
  Exuberance means the quality of being full of energy, excitement, and cheerfulness. Which is the theme of this game, and how I wanted it to feel like! 
  It is also why I use orange, to define excitement and full of spirit! Determination, and such.
