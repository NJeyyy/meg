 A game I made out of spite, yes. at first at least. Though over time the reason change to "just for fun".<br>
 For now, it still a simple game. And the mathematics branch in it, is still.. just the basic of arithmatics lololol. Well, that's about it.
 I make this game mainly for myself and perhaps when I am bored I can play this game while training my brain, though at first it's just a game in a terminal as you see in `meg.py`. But it's kind of a mess, so I figure to
 make the graphic interface too! well.. using web, not exactly a graphic window because I mainly use this on my phone anyways, and termux can't do anything relating to graphic except if I use proot or some sort, which is a hassle and kind of draining my battery too.. so yeah.

 Not much to say currently, but I really want to make this README.md hehe :3c<br>
 Well, that's all I wanted to say. ðŸ˜„ for now..
